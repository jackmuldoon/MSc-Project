Explanations are at the top of each file

the order they should be run is-

1. xtf_read.py
2. grid_stats.py
3. stats_read.py

nav_ran_gen.py has be encorporated into a function

attitude_read_test.py has been used to interpolate and check the attitude data, this needs some more work to interpolate into the work flow.

Plotting of the data is done in qgis.
